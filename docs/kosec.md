# frank
- understand the clients
- rich family houses
- maybe they want to expand to people with money, where do you puyt your money and how do you manage it? or do you want to have a portfolio whcih is yours alone, 
- listed vs unlisted portfolios,
- real gap in the market, for people who had their own share portfolios, randoms go in and want someone to manage the thing for him and who to advise him and manage, stock brokers managed
- who are the clients, what service are you offering
- they may have funds, stock broking, advisory services, probably all in house
- self managed superfund in a trust setup

    - skill , how to know what to invest in, how to manage it, 
    - its like a stockbroker, trade ontheir behalf, i got these shares what do i do with them, time to sell these and buy these ones, admin and tax needs to be done, there a programs that do the accounts, need to know about all the securities, invesments, bonds, then whats sensible for people, 
    - learning, lots of different things, work for a principle of the firm, do the thinking and talking on the phone, go organise it to learn all the ropes, dont worry about, work as hard as i can, gradually get more responsibility, have to earn responsibility, they have to know i can trust this, how to best sell to get the best price
    - sell or buy order

    - no one understands inflation
    - dont have to be an expert, its a real issues in australia
    - infaltionary episode around the world, when governments pump money into the sytem during covid, fed its way through to markets, oil price spike, added to inflation, infaltion starts in one comoodity then moves, oil, petrol, transport, production etc... spike caused by overseas inflation, didnt have enough during covid. if it was just that when oil prices came down infaltion would be gone, it seeps into other things especially wages, when prices go up, wage earners go up, they look to maintain they way of living, to get better jobs, underlying rate of inflation, is above what the reserve bank can accept, for an investment, inflation is damaging, can be making nominal gains, but can be a bad investment at negative because, 
    - real welath = adjusted for inflation, have to earn an amount = inflation, big inflation epsiode, wealth is erroded very quickly, 
    - rba = contain inflation, only real tool is interest rates, interest rates are now close to the peak, will come down but we dont know when or by how much, interest rates started really low, probably caused the spike in housing rates.
    - old rule of thumb, neutral rate 1.5% real, 1.5 above inflation, 
    - auatralian interst rates started really low, you didnt need a high interest rates to screw over people who borrowed alot of money
    - interest rates in australia havent 

    - be interese5ted, spek the language
    - because they didnt go that high they cant drop that low, interest rates have very likely peaked, slowly trickle down but not immeditatly, infaltion is still a bit high for the reserve bank, problem is that wages are the cost of production, anything thats product by wages are embedded wages, 
    - food, manafacture goods, 
    
    - once i get the job i can 
    - the issue is when they will drop and by how much
    - for a long time people with money didnt get interest, banks didnt need it, reserve bank was pumping money into the system, when interest rates went up banks needed moeny again, 
    - 5% is not enough to inflation
    - high networth clients are paying 50%, therefore getting 2.5% of tax, infaltion is 3.5% so they are loosing money

    - meanwhile the sharemarket, alot of shares are interest rate sensitive, for an investor you are competing, companies are competing for fixed interest rate funding
    - yields = 
    - how do you compare investments - yield
    - simple way of doing it, earnings of a company as yield, compare earnings yield of bhp and investment property, different expectations of captial growth, to compare different things look at yields
    - discount of cash flow, the companys embeded earnings into the future indefinitly
    - earnings drive everything, and you know the yield youd expect, youd know the price you want to pay
    - the way in which you compare yields, sometimes called a captialised return, if you know the yield you know the price you can afford to play. 
    
    - earnings yield = earnings / price
    - price = earnings / yield , therefore price
    - yield = 5% = 1 million, = 20 million, = price
    - very simple, keep it simple, 

    - porblem of inflation erroding real assets, tax adjusted returns arent high enough to cover inflation, problem for an investor, what are the best investments to make, of the current yield, w/ dividends or interest but also in terms of capital growth, so for an investment with high current earnings expect lower yield
    - capital growth + income + dividend or interest
    - very simple things but people forget them

    - investment banker, helps clients, have to understand clients, interested in investments, inflation is an issue in australia cause its keeping interest rates high, now investors can invest in fixed interest as an alternative shares - last 2 years, when the rba started pumping money into the system, they allowed you to keep money without charging a fee for it
    - banks are money machines, interest has come back, alt investment, 
    - if i manage moeny im managing fixed interest - property, shres
    
    - where do i put my money now, i have to be interested in the question, pros and cons of different sorts of investments

    - the income from shares is post tax, franking credits, 
    - used to double tax income from companies, now if companies pay tax, they get franking credits, which allows the credits to be tax deductiable, therefore encouraging people to invest
    - not all companies pay tax, so different levels of franking credits
    - dividends can be fully or partically freanked, therefore tax deductable

    - super annuation, tax shletered investments, self managed superfund, 

    - yield, real returns post tax, both tax and infaltion errording investments, return = income + capital growth, different investments have different characterisitcs 


# max
- bps = bips
- general ecomonics
- us economy - navigate a soft landing, slow down inflation without killing economy
- general macro stuff

- germany is on border of recession, 
- market isnt seeing an interest rate first cut till march next year,
- government spending isnt helping inflation, interest rates will stay higher in australia for longer

- they see all these kids that want a high status job that pays realy well, learning about companies in the economy and being involved in important transactions, over and over and over agian in different industries, gives me a solid understanding of how businesses work


- cash flow
- whats gonna impact cash flow
    - sales
    - how profitable they are
    - if they make $1 did it cost them - 50c to product that $1 or 90c to make that $1
    - cap x - capital expendidture - negatively impacting cash flow

# what are questions to ask him? 




# marie
- what questions will 
- what are my strongest qualities
- challenges i've faced and how did i overcome it
- what are typical questions an interviewer might ask for a junior internship for a stockbroker
- why stockbroking?
- whats motivated me to have a change in career from coding to finance?
- 

- highly motivated invidiaul, try have examples of me doing things

- why the comapny? 
    - i like the founder
    - i know a past employee



# what questions will they ask me? 

1. why kosec?

- one of australia's top investment firm's
- you have an office in Chifley Tower home to australias other top financial firms
- there is an office in the US, I have always enjoyed the idea of traveling and experiencing new cultures, so the potential to move overseas in the future is incredibly appealing to me.
- reputation and track record which is proven by all the appearences in media across australia and the globe such as sky news, afr, forbes, bloomberg, smh, the australian
- client focused, i think this is really important when trying to convince poeple why they should give you their money, they have to have a lot of trust, and to become one of australias top investment firms 

2. why stockbroking? 

- client interaction
- global perspective
- continuous learning
- analytical skills
- passion for finance
- career growth
- it's a combination of all of the above, 


- client interaction - this is what I had to do as a ski instructor, sometimes i had high networth clients and I had to convince them to do something they could do but neccesserily something they wanted to do
- global perspective - being able to work in the industry is going to give me a better persective on the global economy and macroecnomics which leans into the continous learning and analytical skills, being able to figure out how a change in laws in one country in one asset class can effect a different asset class in an economy on the other side of the world
- passion for finance - my friends are the ones that have inspried me, as i've got older i've realised how important the work they do is and I would love to be able to have a career and also being able to impact others in a meaningful way


3. how will your experience benefit us

- i am a clear communicator
- i am good on the phone, 
- i have a good sales mentor who was telling me that I will need to figure out within seconds if its going to be an easy or difficult sell which will guide the tactics i use to pitch the asset
- once i am set on doing something i do whatever i can to achieve it 
- i have technical proficiency and a sharp attention to detail

4. tell us about a time you have faced a complicated issue

- when i was working as a developer, there was a feature on the website which enabled the teacher to create zoom lessons, but it was broken, and while fixing it I faced a lot of issues with the zoom api. At first i was just looking at the errors i was immeditaly facing when trying different options. After the first day i thought it was a solveable issue, and everytime i did something I would face a new issue, after day 2 I realised the issue was more complex, so i asked the other coder who worked in a different language for help. So she helped me for a day. Then during the 4th day i realised that i hadnt' read the zoom api documentation, and i was using the incorrect method of authentication. So an issue that took 4 days to solve could have been solved in 20 seconds was very insightful. I learnt a lot from it, the first was to refer to documentation, the second was don't always have to be the big person, it's ok to ask for help. It's better to ask for help sooner than waste time.
